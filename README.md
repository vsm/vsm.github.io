### Announcement :mega:

The license of all modules in the vsmjs project will be updated to the **AGPL** copyleft license, within a few days.

This will protect your right to freely use the vsm-box and other vsmjs modules. But if you modify the source code, the goal is that you have to contribute those modifications back to the community.

Note however that it is NOT required that applications using vsmjs modules be published. The copyleft applies only to the vsm-box etc modules. Your application, even though it talks to vsm-box, is a separate program and "work".

## License

This project is licensed under the AGPL license - see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
